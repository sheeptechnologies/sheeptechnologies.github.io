                <h2>0. Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Filippo, 25 years old. My life has been shaped by physics and programming. Today, observing the
                    frenetic evolution of Artificial Intelligence, I see an ecosystem that is incredible but fragile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What drives me is a concern: we are heading toward a future where AI power is concentrated in the
                    hands of a few. The intelligence is there, but it's locked behind interfaces we don't control,
                    policies we didn't choose, and infrastructure we can't inspect. This scares me — and it's why I
                    started building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sheep is my attempt to change the direction, one primitive at a time.

                <h2>1. The Problem: Access is not Control</h2>
                <p>
                    We are at a historic fork in the road. This isn't just the classic "Open Source vs. Closed Source"
                    debate; it's a question of <strong>engineering viability</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The LLMs themselves — whether proprietary or open-weight — are not the core issue. Excellent models
                    exist and will keep improving. The real problem is that <strong>the applications built on top of
                        them are all closed and proprietary</strong>. If you want an AI assistant today, you must accept
                    someone else's interface, their policies, their data handling. The intelligence is accessible, but
                    the control layer isn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The centralization of social networks taught us what happens when we don't own the infrastructure.
                    Entrusting sensitive data — medical records, financial information, proprietary code — to external
                    black boxes is not just an ethical risk; it's an <strong>unacceptable operational risk</strong>.
                </p>

                    Sheep exists to make the alternative technically possible.

                <h2>2. The Thesis: The Model is the Engine, You Build the Car</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's the core idea: the competitive advantage of tomorrow won't only lie in accessing the smartest
                    LLM (that's becoming a commodity). It will increasingly depend on your ability to <strong>integrate
                        intelligence into your own systems</strong> through architecture you control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A genius model is useless if it can't read your internal database, can't respect your compliance
                    requirements, or leaks your IP to an external cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's missing is <strong>Cognitive Middleware</strong>: a layer that decouples Intelligence (the
                    Model) from Execution (the Action). Not another chatbot. Infrastructure.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="manifest-section">
                <h2>3. What Sheep Actually Is</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's be concrete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sheep is a collection of <strong>open-source libraries</strong> designed for agentic development.
                    They're built to be wrapped by MCP servers and integrated into existing company infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We don't build LLMs.</strong> Training foundation models requires resources and expertise we
                    don't have — and others do it well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We don't sell pre-packaged "AI employees."</strong> We're not in the business of magic
                    agents that promise to replace your team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We build primitives.</strong> Tools that give LLMs the ability to see your data, act on your
                    systems, and remember context — all running on infrastructure you control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These libraries are designed to work <em>with</em> frameworks you might already use (LangChain,
                    LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.), not to replace them. Think of Sheep as the specialized tooling layer
                    beneath your agent orchestration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example use cases:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A physicist who wants to run complex data analysis pipelines with AI assistance, without
                        uploading datasets to external services.</li>
                    <li>A healthcare company that needs AI-powered document processing while guaranteeing GDPR
                        compliance and data residency.</li>
                    <li>An enterprise that wants to build an internal Copilot for their codebase, avoiding per-seat
                        costs and keeping proprietary code in-house.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="manifest-section">
                <h2>4. Why Open Source</h2>
                <p>
                    An open-source model without open tools to orchestrate it is like an engine without a steering
                    wheel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sheep is open source because:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transparency matters.</strong> If you're trusting software with sensitive data, you
                        should be able to audit every line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modularity wins.</strong> Take what you need, ignore what you don't, extend what's
                        missing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Independence is the point.</strong> Your system shouldn't break because a vendor changed
                        their pricing or ToS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We're in the early stages. The libraries exist, the vision is clear, but we're still building
                    traction and community. If you believe in this direction, there are ways to get involved (see
                    below).
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="manifest-section">
                <h2>5. What's Next</h2>
                <p>
                    We're exploring sustainability paths: R&D partnerships with companies who need custom tooling,
                    managed hosting for MCP servers, and consulting for teams building agentic systems. The model is
                    evolving — what won't change is the commitment to keeping the core open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name "Sheep" isn't about following the herd. It's about <strong>swarm intelligence</strong>:
                    small, modular, numerous units that — when well-orchestrated — solve problems better than a single
                    monolith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to enable a new generation of <strong>System Architects</strong>. People who don't just
                    prompt, but design. We build the foundations. You bring the vision, the data, the domain expertise.
                </p>
