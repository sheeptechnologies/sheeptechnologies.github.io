                <p>
                    I’m Filippo, 25 years old. For the past decade, my life has been split between physics and
                    programming. Today, observing the frenetic evolution of Artificial Intelligence, I see an ecosystem
                    that is incredible but fragile. I see a powerful technology risking to become an inaccessible "black
                    box," and I feel the urgency to build the technical primitives necessary to change its direction.

                <h2>1. The Crossroads of 2026: Access is not Control</h2>
                <p>
                    We are at a historic fork in the road. This isn’t just the classic "Open Source vs. Closed Source"
                    battle; it is a question of <strong>engineering viability</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we limit ourselves to accessing models via APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude), we are not building
                    anything of our own. We are tenants of someone else's intelligence. We depend on their policies,
                    their pricing, and their data management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The centralization of social networks taught us that without control over the infrastructure, we are
                    vulnerable. Entrusting sensitive data—medical, financial, proprietary IP—to external black boxes is
                    not just an ethical risk; it is an <strong>unacceptable operational risk</strong>.
                </p>
                <div class="manifest-highlight-box">
                    Sheep was born to solve this practical problem: to provide the tools to make the alternative
                    technically possible.

                <h2>2. The Thesis: Value lies in Middleware, not the Model</h2>
                <p>
                    Here is the heart of the Sheep vision: <strong>The model is the engine, but you must build the
                        car.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow, the competitive advantage will not lie in owning the LLM with the highest IQ (that will
                    become a commodity), but in the capacity to integrate that intelligence into your own processes
                    through a proprietary architecture. Having a genius model is useless if it cannot read your local
                    database or if it violates GDPR constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our thesis is that we need <strong>Cognitive Middleware</strong>: a software layer that decouples
                    Intelligence (the Model) from Execution (the Action).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you want an assistant that writes code based on your internal libraries without handing your IP
                    over to an external cloud?
                    <br>
                    Do you need to analyze sensitive clinical data using the power of AI, but guaranteeing that data
                    never leaves your secure server?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this, we don't need better "chats." We need better control infrastructure.

                <h2>3. What We Do: Primitives for Autonomy</h2>
                <p>
                    To realize this vision, we must be clear about our role in the stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>WE DO NOT develop LLMs</strong>: We do not compete on neural weights. There are already
                    excellent engines out there.
                    <br>
                    <strong>WE DO NOT sell the "magic agent"</strong>: We do not offer pre-packaged digital employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>WE CREATE THE PRIMITIVES (TOOLKIT)</strong>. Sheep develops the Open-Source arsenal
                    necessary to build autonomous intelligent systems. We provide the base modules to give LLMs eyes,
                    hands, and secure memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine wanting to build your own Personal Copilot (<a href="index.html#stack">Crader</a>) or a
                    Secure Data Analyst (<a href="index.html#stack">Crook</a>):

                <ul>
                    <li>We give you the tool to index the code or map the database schema.</li>
                    <li>You connect the model you prefer (Local Llama, GPT-4, Mistral).</li>
                    <li>The tool uses the model to generate logic, but execution happens on your systems, under your
                        control.</li>

                <h2>4. Why Open-Source Tools?</h2>
                <p>
                    An Open Source model without the tools to maneuver it is as useless as an engine without a steering
                    wheel. True independence requires the capacity to inspect and modify the entire assembly line, not
                    just the model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sheep exists to make the Open alternative actionable. We provide free, modular, and agnostic tools
                    so that a medical physicist, a student, or a startup can assemble a solution that:

                <ul>
                    <li>Respects privacy "by design."</li>
                    <li>Does not depend on a monthly subscription to function.</li>
                    <li>Belongs entirely to the person who built it.</li>

                <h2>5. From Users to Architects</h2>
                <p>
                    The era of passive "prompting" is ending. The future belongs to those who can design complex
                    cognitive systems. The name "Sheep" does not imply submission, but rather the nature of Distributed
                    Systems (swarm intelligence): small, modular, numerous units that, if well-orchestrated, solve huge
                    problems better than a single central monolith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't want you to be just a user. We want to enable a new class of <strong>System
                        Architects</strong>. We build the infrastructural foundations. You bring the vision, the data,
                    and the domain logic.
